let you =" are the reason";
//You have Declared a variable called "you" using the let keyword and initialized it with a String datatype. 
var we = " the next generation of programmer";
//You have Declared and Initialized a variable called "We" of type String using the var keyword.
const us = ' we are upcoming software problem solvers';
//You have declared and initialized a constant called "us" of type String using the const keyword ,but at any one point in time,this constant cannot be assigned another value.
let num1 = 5;
//You have Declared a variable called num1 of type Number using the let keyword and Initialized it to 5;
let num2 = 10;
//You have Declared a variable called num2 of type Number using the let keyword and Initialized it to 10;
let num3 = num2 += num1;
//You have Declared a variable called num3 using the let keyword and Initialized it to an expression num2 += num1 which is the same as num2 = num2 + num1 and equates to 15, Therefore a value 15 will be assigned to num3
let ans = num1 % num2;
//You are trying to declare a variable ans and assigning it to the reminder when num1 is divided by num2 BUT the ans variable is has an error, Which can means you have already declared it before but at this point you haven't or you have declared it again later in the code.h
console.log(ans);
//You are trying to output the value assigned to ans to the console
console.log(num3 *= 2);
// You are outputing the new value of num3 to the console(Terminal) after the expression num3 *= 2 is computered which means num3 = num3 multiplied by 2 where num3 will be assigned 15 multiplied by 2 which is 30.Therefore 30 will be outputted as the new value of num3.
var num4;
//You have decleared a variable called num4 with the var keyword but you have not initialized it or assigned it a value.
console.log(num4);
//You are outputting a variable num4 to the console(Terminal) but since it wasn't assigned anything it will print Undefined.
console.log(2num6);
//You are trying to output num6 which was never decleared anywhere in this module, and a number cannot immediately follow a variable like that, therefore its an error.
var ans = 'this is not right';
//Once again You are trying to declare a variable name ans and assigning it to a String which was already declared in the module, therefore this is an error.
var let ='do you know what you are doing?';
//You have Declared and Initialized a variable called "let" of type String using the var keyword. But using keywords should be avoided, maybe since let is one of the newest keyword its not fully incoperated as a keyword.
const dad;
//You have declared a constant called dad, but constant declarations must always be initialized, therefore this is an error.
const myNum = num1>num2? num3:us;
//You have declared a variable called myNum and initialized it to a Ternary operator and therefore the value of myNum will be based on the condition if num1 is greater than num2, if this is true, num3 will be assigned as the value myNum but if its false, then "us" will be assigned as the value myNum and in this case it is false, so the value of myNum is "us" which is a string.
console.log(--num3);
//You are outputting the value of num3 but after pre-decrementing (subtracting) it by 1, since the last value of num3 was 30, therefore the output to the console is 29
console.log(num3);
//You're outputting the value of num3 to the console which is 29
console.log(num3++);
//You're outputting the value of num3 to the console with a post increment, since post increment works in away that it will increment(add) 1 to the value of num3 after use, the output here will still be 29.
console.log(num2 != num3);
//You are outputting a comparision of num2 is not equal to num3 which will print a boolean value true because the value of num2 which 10 is not the same as the value of num3 which is 29.
console.log(num3 !=num2 && num2==num2);
//You are outputting a comparision of two conditions using a logical 'And' operator which translates to num3 not equal to num2 'And' num2 is equal to num2, the output is true because all these conditions are true and the logical And operator requires both statements to be true

if(100>=200){
	const num2 =20;
	console.log('you are now a junior developer');
}
//An if statement that will execute a block of code if the condition 100 is greater than 200 is true but in this case it is false therefore a the block of code will not be excuted meaning the constant variable num2 will not be created and nothing will be outputted to the console.
