let you =" are the reason";
//A variable "you" is assigned a value "are the reason" which is a string.
var we = " the next generation of programmer";
//Variable "we" is assigned  a value "the next generation of programmer". The group of word in the double quotes is called a string. 
const us = ' we are upcoming software problem solvers';
//A constant variable is declared "us" and assigned value 'we are upcoming software problem solvers'. When a variable is declared as const, it means it is a constant. It's value cannot be changed. 
let num1 = 5;
//Value "5" which is a number is assigned to a declared variable 'num1'. The variable here is (let). 5 is the assigned value. num1 is the declaration.
let num2 = 10;
//Value "10" is assigned to a declared variable 'num2'.
let num3 = num2 += num1;
//The value of the declared variable num3 is assigned the concantination of values for variables num2 and num1 (10+5) which is 15.
let ans = num1 % num2;
//The variable declared "ans" is assigned the remainder of the divided values of variables num1 and num2.
console.log(ans);
//Displaying the current value of variable declared ans which is 15.
console.log(num3 *= 2);
//The value of the declared variable "num3" is multiplied by 2 ,so the value to be displayed will be 30. (15*2 which gives us 30)
var num4;
//The value of the declared variable "num4" is undefined. The statement is incomplete. It does not tell the computer what exactly to do with num4. 
console.log(num4);
//The display is "undefined" since the variable num4 lacks a value.
console.log(2num6);
//Since the variable name begins with a number, it returns as an error because variable names should neither begin with a number nor capital letter unless when using camelCase or underscore.
var ans = 'this is not right';
//A variable declared "ans" is assigned value 'this is not right'.
var let ='do you know what you are doing?';
//Its not advisable to declare a variable with a key-word (var,let,const,class etc), so it returns an error. var and let are all declaration statements. They cannot follow after each other.
const dad;
//A constant variable declared "dad" lacks a value , so its undefined.
const myNum = num1>num2? num3:us;
//Declare a constant variable "myNum" and assign it the value of num3 if the value of num1 is greater than the value of num2 but if not , the value the variable myNum will be that of variable "us".
console.log(--num3);
//Pre-decrement decreases 1 from the value of num3 at first and display result as "29".
console.log(num3);
//Display "29" as the value of num3 since 1 was subtracted from the value of num3 which was "30".
console.log(num3++);
//Post-increment adds 1 to the value of num3 and display 29 as return at first , then displays "30" as return after.
console.log(num2 != num3);
//The value of num2 is not equal to value of num3 so it displays true since value of num2 is not equal to that of num3.
console.log(num3 !=num2 && num2==num2);
//The display returns true since its true that num3 is not equal to num2 while num2 is equal to num2 or esle it would be false.

if(100>=200){

//If it's true that 100 is greater or equal to 200, then assigned a value of 20 to a variable num2. If that condition is true, print the message 'you are now a junior developer' otherwise nothing will be printed.
